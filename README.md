# Landing Page Template

This landing page was created as per The Odin Project.
See: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page

This project has taught and refined my skills in HTML and CSS. Through the use of div's and text, I gained valuable knowledge in the best ways to position elements correctly.
This project also taught me the importance of display: flex, and how to correctly implement it.

I created this 100% by myself using only the knowledge from The Odin Project.
